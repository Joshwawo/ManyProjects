He had become ill with fever on January 17, a total of 4 days after he and his wife had flown to Hanoi from the Wuchang district in Wuhan, where outbreaks of 2019-nCoV were occurring. He reported that he had not been exposed to a “wet market” (a market where dead and live animals are sold) in Wuhan.

      "When patient presented to ED there was wide spread opacity across patient right lung field especially on lower lung field with positive air-bronchogram which indicate consolidation of right lower or middle lobe. There was some opacity just above the right horizontal fissure which may suggest progression of infection into right upper lobe. The right heart border was lost. During her admission at hospital, the opacity spread to right upper lobe and started to develop opacity on left lung field and more prominent air-bronchogram which consistent with wide spread of infection across both lung. Endotracheal tube can be seen at 2nd day of admission.",

      "The patient has been receiving cough and dyspnoea for about 5 days and has therefore taken first therapy with amoxicillin / clavulanic acid per os and subsequently im ceftriaxione without benefit. He reports that he made a train journey from Florence to Rome (train from Venice) during which he had contacts with people from the red zone on 24 February. Patient with arterial hypertension in home therapy with Neolotan and Tiklid. On physical examination, it appears slightly tachypnoic at rest, asymptomatic for thoraco-abdominal pain, complains of dyspnea, MV diffusely reduced, basal crepitation on the left. Softened confluent densities with peripheral distribution with associated thickening of the interstitial weft. No pleural effusion.",

His O2 saturation was initially 58% on room air and 89% on 15 litres of Oxygen via non-rebreather mask, Heart rate of 146 and Blood pressure of 143/81. Chest X-Ray shows extensive bilateral inflammatory changes. Basic blood tests show raised inflammatory markers (CRP 135), raised D-dimers and normal lymphocytes. CT Pulmonary Angiography revealed Widespread patchy airspace change likely pulmonary haemorrhages. Patient was admitted to ITU and had full immunology , virology, microbiology and rheumatology screens done. He tested negative for all investigations done including HIV, HCV, HBV, TB and connective tissue diseases. Patient tested positive of COVID-19. He later deteriorated and required invasive support.

      "84M with COPD, HFpEF, and BPH with recurrent UTIs. Was in his USOH and recovering from recent admission for UTI and subsequent stay in short-term rehab 2 weeks ago. Found unresponsive by wife at home with labored breathing. Afebrile, hypoxic and tachycardic in the field, arrived to ED on non-rebreather satting well but altered and in respiratory distress, intubated for airway protection. CBC/BMP completely unremarkable aside from anion gap of 19 and leukocytosis 16. CXR (image 1) showed some questionable linear opacities compared to recent prior, and there was concern for infection given #COVID-19 epidemic and respiratory distress. However further labs revealed POC trop 2.16, BNP 4K, VBG pH 7.37, lactate 4.3. EKG showed new RBBB and S1Q3T3 pattern (image 2, right). Echo (image 2, left) showed severely dilated RV, apical hypokinesis and McConnell's sign. PERT code was activated and pt was taken for stat CTA (image 3) revealing massive #Pulmonaryembolism (?saddle) but predominately occluding the entire R side. Systemic thrombolysis was considered, however, pt had known meningioma, which showed interval growth on stat CT head, raising concern for bleed. Within 4h of presentation, pt was taken to IR suite for embolectomy, which was successful at restoring flow to entire R lung field (image 4). Involvement of L pulmonary artery was non-occlusive and not intervened on. After the procedure, pt was taken for LE dopplers (image 5), which identified residual clot burden in the L profunda femoral vein. The following day, pt was extubated to room air and made a full recovery.",

      "Admitted with small bowel obstruction. Developed a fever with rigors. Reduced air entry with crepitations in the right mid zone. Peripheral right upper lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and peribronchial cuffing. Associated horizontal fissure displacement superiorly, with outlining of the fissure. Small right sided pleural effusion. Classic appearance of a right upper lobe pneumonia. The infection is confined to the upper lobe by the horizontal fissure. Lobar pneumonia is usually caused by typical organisms – such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

      'History of HIV, loss of viral suppression, a few weeks of shortness of breath, cough, malaise and weight loss. Although there is no focus of airspace opacification, there is hazy ground glass involving both lungs and a reticular pattern of opacification.  The lungs are of normal volume, there is no collapse and no pleural effusion. Further features in the history were gradual weight loss.  A whole body CT was performed to look for sources of infection and lymphadenopathy. A mid and lower zone diffuse ground glass pattern was seen, with admixed areas of interlobular septal thickening, giving a "crazy paving" pattern. Some small cystic spaces were observed too.  No nodules, nodes or pleural effusions were seen. The heart was not enlarged.',

      "Female patient, 71 years old, transferred to the DEA from the local PS with the diagnosis of dyspnea, reported 3 days (39 °) fever; Pcs resident in common with multiple COVID-19 cases. In a history of COPD with moderate respiratory failure. Pz disponoica, tachipnoica, tachycardia with pO2 93% in ambient air. Chest x-ray is required and considering the epidemiological link, a buffer (positive for SARS-CoV-2) and isolation of the patient is carried out. The X-ray investigation demonstrates a widespread increase in the peribroncovascular interstitial texture with associated bilateral bilateral parenchymal thickenings arranged in the peripheral location. Pleural effusion on the right with obliteration of the costophrenic sinus on this side. The Pz is assisted and treated in an MU (department dedicated to COVID-19 patients) and after about 1 week it shows significant improvements as evident from the first control CT performed about 8 days after hospitalization.",

      "A 61-year-old male non-smoking patient presented with dyspnoea (respiratory rate 25/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation 67%) and fever (38.3°C). Apart from pre-existing arterial hypertension, there were no risk factors or known pathogen exposure. Blood analysis showed normal leucocytes, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (106.3mg/l; normal range <5mg/l) and a normal procalcitonin level (0.12µg/l; normal range <0.50µg/l). Glomerular filtration rate was reduced (47ml/min). Reverse transcription polymerase change reaction (RT-PCR) for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was positive, Influenza tests were negative. As dyspnoea deteriorated, the patient was admitted to our intensive care unit. Under continuous invasive ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics CRP levels rose to 300mg/l and fever continued over the next 4 days. With the impending need of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a chest CT scan was performed. Chest X-ray at initial presentation showed bilateral pulmonary consolidation in mid-and lower zones (Figs. 1a and b).",

      "A 30-year-old female patient with a past medical history of asthma, morbid obesity (BMI 39.5), and hypertension on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor presented with a 6-day history of fever (Tmax 38.9°C), cough, and shortness of breath. Laboratory studies were remarkable for lymphopenia (0.6×103/µL, normal range 0.9×103/µL – 3.3×103/µL), elevated serum creatinine (1.3 mg/dL, normal range 0.6 mg/dL – 1.2 mg/dL), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (73 IU/L, normal range 13 IU/L – 39 IU/L), elevated c-reactive protein (8.6 mg/dL, normal range 0 – 1 mg/dL), elevated procalcitonin (2.39 ng/mL, normal < 0.1 ng/mL), elevated interleukin-6 (197 pg/mL, normal ≤ 5 pg/mL), elevated cardiac troponin I (142 ng/L, normal < 15 ng/L), and mildly elevated d-dimer (570 ng/mL, normal < 500 ng/mL). She reported a history of contact with a COVID-positive co-worker and no recent travel. Influenza A/B RT-PCR were negative. She developed acute respiratory distress and was emergently intubated. Prone portable PA chest X-ray on second day of admission demonstrates persistent airspace opacities, cardiomegaly and haziness of the cardiac borders (Fig. 3).",
